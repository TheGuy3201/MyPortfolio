# EmailJS Setup Guide (No Password Required!)

## What is EmailJS?
EmailJS allows you to send emails directly from your client-side JavaScript without needing any server-side email configuration or passwords.

## Setup Steps:

### 1. Create EmailJS Account
1. Go to https://www.emailjs.com/
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Free tier allows 200 emails/month

### 2. Connect Your Email Service
1. In EmailJS dashboard, go to "Email Services"
2. Click "Add Service"
3. Choose "Gmail" 
4. Click "Connect Account" and authorize with your Google account
5. No password needed - it uses OAuth!

### 3. Create Email Template
1. Go to "Email Templates" in EmailJS dashboard
2. Click "Create New Template"
3. Use this template:

```
Subject: Portfolio Contact: {{subject}}

From: {{from_name}} <{{from_email}}>
Phone: {{phone}}

Message:
{{message}}

---
This email was sent from your portfolio contact form.
Reply to: {{from_email}}
```

### 4. Get Your Configuration
After setup, you'll get:
- **Service ID** (e.g., "service_abc123")
- **Template ID** (e.g., "template_def456") 
- **Public Key** (e.g., "user_ghi789")

### 5. Update Contact Form
Replace the placeholder values in Contact.jsx:

```javascript
await emailjs.send(
  'your_service_id',    // Replace with your Service ID
  'your_template_id',   // Replace with your Template ID
  {
    from_name: form.fullName,
    from_email: form.email,
    phone: form.phone,
    subject: form.subject || 'Portfolio Contact Message',
    message: form.message,
    to_email: 'josh.des.21@gmail.com'
  },
  'your_public_key'     // Replace with your Public Key
);
```

## Benefits:
✅ **No passwords required** - Uses OAuth authentication
✅ **No server-side email config** - Works entirely client-side
✅ **Free tier available** - 200 emails/month

## Alternative Options:

### Option 2: Formspree (Form Handler Service)

- Create account and get form endpoint
- Change form action to Formspree URL
- No JavaScript needed

### Option 3: Netlify Forms (if hosting on Netlify)
- Add `netlify` attribute to your form
- Netlify automatically handles form submissions
- Emails sent to your specified address

### Option 4: Contact Form Services
