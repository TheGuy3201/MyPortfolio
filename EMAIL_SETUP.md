# Email Configuration Instructions

## Current Setup
✅ **Email Service** - Configured with Nodemailer for Gmail SMTP
✅ **Contact Form** - Updated to send emails when submitted
✅ **Database Storage** - Contact messages are still saved to MongoDB
✅ **Admin Panel** - Admins can view all contact messages

## Email Features Added
1. **Automatic Email Sending** - When someone submits the contact form, an email is sent to josh.des.21@gmail.com
2. **Rich HTML Format** - Emails include name, email, phone, subject, and message in a well-formatted HTML template
3. **Reply-To Setup** - You can reply directly to the email to respond to the person who contacted you
4. **Error Handling** - If email sending fails, the contact is still saved to the database

## To Enable Email Sending
You need to configure Gmail App Password:

1. Go to https://myaccount.google.com/security
2. Enable 2-Factor Authentication (if not already enabled)
3. Go to "App passwords" section
4. Generate an App Password for this portfolio application
5. Update the .env file with your App Password:
   ```
   EMAIL_PASS=your-16-character-app-password-here
   ```

## Current Status
- **✅ Working**: Contact form saves to database and shows success message
- **⚠️ Pending**: Email sending requires Gmail App Password setup
- **✅ Ready**: All code is in place and will work once credentials are configured

## Testing
1. Submit a contact form message
2. Check the server console for email sending logs
3. Check josh.des.21@gmail.com for received emails (once App Password is configured)
4. Admin can view all messages at /admin/contacts
